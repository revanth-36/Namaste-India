              The Brahmaputra River, known as the "Son of Brahma," is one of the major rivers of Asia, flowing through China, India, and Bangladesh. Originating in the Himalayas, near Lake Mansarovar in Tibet, it traverses across the Tibetan Plateau before entering India through the state of Arunachal Pradesh. As it journeys through the Indian states of Assam and Meghalaya, the Brahmaputra is joined by several tributaries, including the Dibang, Lohit, and Subansiri rivers, which significantly contribute to its volume. The river then enters Bangladesh, where it merges with the Ganges to form the world's largest river delta, the Sundarbans Delta, before emptying into the Bay of Bengal. The Brahmaputra plays a vital role in the economy and culture of the region, supporting agriculture, transportation, and livelihoods of millions of people. Its rich biodiversity and scenic landscapes make it a popular destination for river cruises, wildlife enthusiasts, and tourists seeking to explore the natural wonders of Northeast India and Bangladesh.
