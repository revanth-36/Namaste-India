                The limestone caves of the Andaman Islands stand as ancient geological marvels, each cavern a testament to the inexorable forces of nature over eons. Carved and sculpted by the patient work of water and time, these subterranean labyrinths hold within their depths a world of wonder and mystery. Stalactites hang like chandeliers from the cave ceilings, while stalagmites rise majestically from the cave floor, creating an otherworldly landscape of intricate formations. Guided tours lead adventurers through dimly lit passages, where every twist and turn reveals a new marvel of nature's craftsmanship. The cool, damp air within the caves offers a welcome respite from the tropical heat above, inviting exploration and contemplation. As visitors venture deeper into the heart of these ancient chambers, they are transported back in time, tracing the geological history of the islands etched into the very rock itself. Exploring the limestone caves is a journey into the very soul of the Andaman Islands, a glimpse into the hidden wonders that lie beneath the surface of this island paradise.
